# logseq-vertical-panels

A (very) basic css to have vertical panels in Logseq right sidebar.

There's lot of room for improvements (aka caveats in the current system). For example, 

* when you minimize the panels, they close vertically and not horizontally
* the entire right sidebar can be resized but not individual panels

(TODO: Add credits to people in the css and readme)
