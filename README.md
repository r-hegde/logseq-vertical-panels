# Logseq Vertical Panels for Sidebar

A basic css to have vertical panels in [Logseq](https://logseq.github.io/#/page/Contents) right sidebar.

There's lot of room for improvements (aka caveats in the current system). For example, 

* when you minimize the panels, they close vertically and not horizontally

## Installation

### Only Vertical Panels

Copy the code in [vertical-panels.css](https://github.com/r-hegde/logseq-vertical-panels/blob/main/vertical-panels.css) and paste it in your Logseq custom.css. 

### Entire Theme

The [custom.css](https://github.com/r-hegde/logseq-vertical-panels/blob/main/custom.css) has the whole theme, including the vertical panels for sidebar. The theme is largely inspired by logseq-dev-theme. I have customized the theme as per my personal preferences, so if you're using this please proceed with caution.
